# Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Elements are added and removed from the same end, called the top of the stack.

## Characteristics of Stack:
- **LIFO Principle:** The last element added is the first one to be removed.
- **Dynamic Size:** Stacks can grow or shrink as needed.
- **Single Access Point:** Only the top element is accessible for operations.

## Operations on Stack:
- **Push:** Adding an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop:** Removing the top element from the stack.
- **Peek/Top:** Accessing the top element without removing it.
- **IsEmpty:** Checking if the stack is empty.

## Applications of Stack:
- Function call management (call stack).
- Expression evaluation (infix, postfix, prefix).
- Undo mechanisms in applications.
- Backtracking algorithms.

## Operations on Stack:
- **Push:** Adding an element to the top of the stack.
  - Time Complexity: O(1)
- **Pop:** Removing the top element from the stack.
  - Time Complexity: O(1)
- **Peek/Top:** Accessing the top element without removing it.
  - Time Complexity: O(1)
- **IsEmpty:** Checking if the stack is empty.
