# Array
An array is a linear data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type.

## Operations on Array:
- **Traversal:** Iterating through the elements of an array.
- **Insertion:** Adding an element to the array at a specific index.
- **Deletion:** Removing an element from the array at a specific index.
- **Searching:** Finding an element in the array by its value or index.

## Types of Arrays:
- **One-dimensional array:** A simple array with a single dimension.
- **Multidimensional array:** An array with multiple dimensions, such as a matrix.

## Applications of Array:
- Storing data in a sequential manner.
- Implementing queues, stacks, and other data structures.
- Representing matrices and tables.

## Time Complexity:
- **Access:** O(1)
- **Search:** O(n)
- **Insertion (at beginning):** O(n)
- **Insertion (at end):** O(1) (if capacity allows), O(n) (if resizing is needed)
- **Insertion (at middle):** O(n)
- **Deletion (at beginning):** O(n)
- **Deletion (at end):** O(1)
- **Deletion (at middle):** O(n)

## Space Complexity:
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) (for storing n elements)
- **Auxiliary Space:** O(1) (no additional space required, assuming static array)
