# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Notes

## Introduction

### Data Strucures
- : Organizing the data in memory.

### Algorithms
- : A set of instructions to solve a problem.

## Characters of alogorithms
- **Input**
- **Output**
- **Unambiguity**
- **Finiteness**
- **Effectiveness**
- **Language independend**

### Complexity analyasis
- **Time Complexity** : How much time does it take to execute an algorithm.
- **Space Complexity** : How much space does it take to execute an algorithm.

### Time Complexity
- **O(1)**: Constant time
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time
- **O(n)**: Linear time
- **O(n log n)**: Linearithmic time
- **O(n^2)**: Quadratic time
- **O(2^n)**: Exponential time
- **O(n!)**: Factorial time

### Space Complexity of Data Types
- **Integer**: 4 bytes
- **Float**: 4 bytes
- **Double**: 8 bytes
- **Character**: 1 byte
- **Boolean**: 1 byte
- **String**: n bytes (where n is the length of the string)
- **Array**: n * size of element (where n is the number of elements in the array)
- **Linked List**: n * size of node (where n is the number of nodes in the linked list)
- **Tree**: n * size of node (where n is the number of nodes in the tree)
- **Graph**: n * size of node + m * size of edge (where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges)
